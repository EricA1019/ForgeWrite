# Session Bootstrap

If you haven't already read `AGENTS.md`, read it now — it contains the project identity, non-negotiables, and commands.

Then read this file fully before doing anything else in this session.

## Current Project State

**Working:**
- 14-state SliceCoordinator pipeline (validate → context → generate → schema → semantic → preview → approve → apply → validate → repair)
- 10 MCP tools over stdio with stdout-to-stderr redirect to prevent protocol corruption
- 12 CLI commands (init, doctor, approve, show-diff, inspect, restore, abort, gc, runs list, project status)
- 6 operation handlers via registry (create_file, replace_file, replace_line_range, insert_after_line, insert_before_line, delete_file)
- 7 config sections with Pydantic validation (project, local_model, limits, validation, permissions, hygiene, repair)
- Git snapshot create/restore with TOCTOU re-check on apply
- Hash-bound terminal approval with fcntl file locking
- LlamaCppClient with exponential backoff retry + circuit breaker
- Centralized dead_letter writer + JSONL audit event log
- Markdown run summary generator
- 180 unit tests, 0 failures
- CI pipeline (ruff, mypy, pytest, pip-audit, semgrep, trivy)

**Not yet built:**
- End-to-end acceptance tests with real llama.cpp + OmniCoder (Phase 6)

**Known issues:**
- All 8 audit findings (B1-B3, N1-N5) resolved — see docs/remediation-plan.md

## Routing Table

Load the relevant file based on the current task. Always load `context/architecture.md` first if not already in context this session.

| Task type | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Understanding how the system works | `context/architecture.md` |
| Working with a specific technology | `context/stack.md` |
| Writing or reviewing code | `context/conventions.md` |
| Making a design decision | `context/decisions.md` |
| Setting up or running the project | `context/setup.md` |
| Any specific task | Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern |

## Behavioural Contract

For every task, follow this loop:

1. **CONTEXT** — Load the relevant context file(s) from the routing table above. Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern. If one exists, follow it. Narrate what you load: "Loading architecture context..."
2. **BUILD** — Do the work. If a pattern exists, follow its Steps. If you are about to deviate from an established pattern, say so before writing any code — state the deviation and why.
3. **VERIFY** — Load `context/conventions.md` and run the Verify Checklist item by item. State each item and whether the output passes. Do not summarise — enumerate explicitly.
4. **DEBUG** — If verification fails or something breaks, check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a debug pattern. Follow it. Fix the issue and re-run VERIFY.
5. **GROW** — After completing the task:
   - If no pattern exists for this task type, create one in `patterns/` using the format in `patterns/README.md`. Add it to `patterns/INDEX.md`. Flag it: "Created `patterns/<name>.md` from this session."
   - If a pattern exists but you deviated from it or discovered a new gotcha, update it with what you learned.
   - If any `context/` file is now out of date because of this work, update it surgically — do not rewrite entire files.
   - Update the "Current Project State" section above if the work was significant.
